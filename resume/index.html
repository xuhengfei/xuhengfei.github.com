<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>I commonly use Adobe Fireworks for design mockups for website designs before proceeding to code them. In the past I have used Dreamweaver in order to produce websites from start to finish, although I now prefer to hand-code sites as it provides more flexibility and more options for incorporating new technologies. When building websites, particularly larger sites I use GIT as a version control system, for example I manage my personal portfolio site with GIT in order to make it easier to develop, test and deploy new features.</p>
<p>When FTP is required I use Transmit on my MacBook, or FileZilla on any other platform, while coding my editor of choice is Espresso or TextMate, although I am open to almost anything. During my first year at university I used Flash in order to make a Flash game.</p>

<h3>Interests/Activities</h3>
<p>I have a large range of activities that I partake in on a regular basis. I am currently the Cross-Country representative for the University of Plymouth Cycling Club, where I organise weekly rides or varying length and difficulty, often out onto Dartmoor. I am also an active climber and spend a lot of time at the Bristol Climbing centre when back at home. I am a frequent visitor to areas such as the Lake District where I partake in activities such as backpacking, hiking and camping.</p>
<p>Wherever I am it is common to see me out with my D-SLR, I am a huge fan of photography, suing it as a lone hobby when doing shots such as landscapes or combined with other hobbies, for example I often take my camera mountain biking.</p>
<p>On top of this I am constantly online developing my online presence through web design. other hobbies include reading, listening to music and watching DVDs. I was a member of the Air Training Corps for four years.
