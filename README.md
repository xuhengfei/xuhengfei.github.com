Blog Template Source from [Daniel Groves](https://github.com/danielgroves/danielgroves.net)
This is the source for the current version of my portfolio. This may seem stagnent at times as I tend to keep development stuff privatly on my own GitLab install and only push changes over here when they go live on the site. 

My site has previously been a static site with no generator behind it and [WordPress](http://wordpress.org "WordPress Publishing Platform") based. 

## Usage

Setting up and using the site is pretty easy. Make sure you have Ruby install, install the Jekyll gem and then run the server. Once you have Ruby installed:

```bash
gem install jekyll
cd projest/directory/
jekyll --server
```

Then simply go to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.
